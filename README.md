## Part One - Project Planning, Model Objects and Controllers, Persistence with Core Data

### View Hierarchy

Set up a basic List-Detail view hierarchy using a UITableViewController for a TaskListTableViewController and a TaskDetailTableViewController.

1. Add a UITableViewController scene that will be used to list tasks
2. Embed the scene in a UINavigationController
3. Add an Add system bar button item to the navigation bar
4. Add a class file `TaskListTableViewController.swift` and assign the scene in the Storyboard
5. Add a UITableViewController scene that will be used to add and view tasks
    * note: We will use a static table view for our Task Detail view, static table views should be used sparingly, but they can be useful for a table view that will never change, such as a basic form.
6. Add a segue from the Add bar button item from the first scene to the second scene
7. Add a segue from the prototype cell in the first scene to the second scene
8. Add a class file `TaskDetailTableViewController.swift` and assign the scene in the Storyboard
    * note: We will finish building our views later on


### Add a Core Data Stack

You will add a CoreDataStack class that will initialize your persistent store, coordinator, and managed object context. Then you will build your Core Data data model.

1. Create a new file called `CoreDataStack.swift`.
2. Import `CoreData` and then add the following code to the file:
```
enum CoreDataStack {

    static let container: NSPersistentContainer = {

        let appName = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: (kCFBundleNameKey as String)) as! String
        let container = NSPersistentContainer(name: appName)
        container.loadPersistentStores() { (storeDescription, error) in
            if let error = error as NSError? {
                fatalError("Unresolved error \(error), \(error.userInfo)")
            }
        }
        return container
    }()

    static var context: NSManagedObjectContext { return container.viewContext }
}
```
* note: Be sure you understand what is going on in each line of code in your `CoreDataStack`


### Implement Core Data Model

1. Create a new Data Model template file (File -> New -> File -> Data Model) and be sure to use the app name for the name of the Data Model.
2. Add a New Entity called Task with attributes for name (String), notes (String), due (Date), and isComplete (Bool).
3. Use the Data Model inspector to set notes and due to optional values and give isComplete a default value of false.
4. At this point Xcode will automatically create your CoreDataClass and CoreDataProperties files for you.
    * note: Remember that when we create Core Data types they are `NSManagedObject` subclasses. Thus, `Task` is a subclass of `NSManagedObject`.

Now you need to add a convenience initializer for your `Task` objects that matches what would normally be a memberwise initializer. NSManagedObjects have a designated initializer called `init(entity: NSEntityDescription, insertInto context: NSManagedObjectContext?)` and a convenience initializer called `init(context moc: NSManagedObjectContext)`. You will write your own convenience initializer that uses the `NSManagedObject` convenience initializer and sets the properties on a `Task` object.

1. Create a new file called `Task+Convenience.swift`.
2. Add an extension to `Task` and create your convenience initializer inside of the extension
    * note: Make sure the initializer has parameters for `name`, `notes`, `due`, and `context` and that each parameter takes in the right type (`context` will be of type `NSManagedObjectContext`).
    * note: Remember that `notes` and `due` are optional, therefore, you can give them default values of `nil`. Also, give `context` a default value of `CoreDataStack.context`.
3. Inside the body of the initializer set your `Task` properties and call the `NSManagedObject` convenience initializer and pass in `context` from your own convenience initializer --> `self.init(context: context)`


### Controller Basics

Create a TaskController model object controller that will manage and serve Task objects to the rest of the application. The TaskController will also handle persistence using Core Data.

1. Create a `TaskController.swift` file and define a new `TaskController` class inside.
2. Create a `shared` property as a shared instance. 
3. Add a `tasks` Array property with an empty default value.
4. Create function signatures for `add(taskWithName name: String, notes: String?, due: Date?)`, `update(task: Task, name: String, notes: String?, due: Date?)`, `remove(task: Task)`, `saveToPersistentStore()`, and `fetchTasks() -> [Task]`.


### Controller Staged Data Using a Mock Data Function

Add mock task data to the TaskController. Once there is mock data, teams can serialize work, with some working on the views with visible data and others working on implementing the controller logic. This is a quick way to get objects visible so you can begin building the views.

There are many ways to add mock data to model object controllers. We will do so using a computed property.

1. Create a `mockTasks: [Task]` computed property that will hold a number of staged Task objects
2. Initialize a small number of Task objects with varying properties (include at least one 'isComplete' task and one task with a due date)

Generally, when you use mock data, you set `self.tasks` to `self.mockTasks` in the initializer and then remove it when you no longer need mock data. In this case, we will be setting our mock data through our `fetchTasks() -> [Task]` function since that is what we will be doing when we use real data.

1. In your controller's initializer, set the `tasks` array equal to the return of your `fetchTasks() -> [Task]` function.
    * note: If you have not added an initializer, add one.
2. In your `fetchTasks() -> [Task]` function return your mock tasks computed property.

At this point, you can wire up your list table view to display the complete or incomplete tasks to check your progress on Part One.


### Basic Task List View

Go to `TaskListTableViewController.swift` and finish setting up your views.

You will want this view to reload the table view each time it appears in order to display newly created tasks.

1. Implement the UITableViewDataSource functions using the TaskController tasks array
2. Set up your cells to display the name of the task (we'll create a custom table view cell later so we'll have to come back to this function later and change some things)
3. Reload the table view in `viewWillAppear(_:)`


### List View Editing

Add swipe-to-delete support for deleting tasks from the List View.

1. Implement the UITableViewDataSource `tableView(_:commit:forRowAt:)` function to enable swipe to delete functionality.
2. Using the `indexPath` from the function parameter, grab the task out of your tasks array on `TaskController` that you want to delete and then call `TaskController.shared.remove(task:)` to delete it. Then delete the row from the table view.
    * note: You haven't filled out the remove function on `TaskController` yet, we will do that later, but we will set it up so that it will delete a `Task` object.


### Detail View Setup

Go to your `TaskDetailTableViewController` scene in storyboard and finish setting up the views.

You will use a UITextField to capture the name of a task, a UITextView to capture notes, and a 'Save' UIBarButtonItem to save the task.

Look at the task detail screenshot in the project folder and set up the Storyboard scene with all of the required user interface elements to appear similarly.

1. Update the table view to use static cells and make sure the style is 'Grouped'
2. Create three separate sections, each with one cell (you'll have to delete two cells from each section)
3. Change the name of the header in the first section to 'Name' and add a UITextField to the cell with placeholder text
    * note: Placeholder text should tell the user what they should put in the text field
4. Change the name of the header in the second section to 'Due' and add a UITextField to the cell with placeholder text
5. Change the name of the header in the third section to 'Notes' and add a text view to the cell
6. Resize the UI elements and add constraints so that they fill each cell
7. Add a Navigation Item to the Navigation Bar and then add two UIBarButtonItems to the Navigation Bar and change the System Item of one of them to 'Save' and to 'Cancel' for the other 


### Setup the TaskDetailTableViewController class

1. Delete boilerplate code from your `TaskDetailTableViewController` class
    * note: Since the task detail table view is a static table view you don't need `UITableViewDataSource` functions, so you can delete those as well.
2. Add an optional `task` property of type `Task?` and an optional `dueDateValue` property of type `Date?`
3. Add the appropriate outlets and IBActions from your detail scene in storyboard to your `TaskDetailTableViewController` class.
    * note: The IBAction for your 'Save' bar button item should save a new task if the `task` property is nil and update the existing task otherwise (even though we haven't set it yet, use `dueDateValue` for the date that you pass into your `add` and `update` functions.
    * note: If you want, you can create another function called `updateTask()` that will do this for you and then call that function in your IBAction.
    * note: The IBAction for your 'Cancel' bar button item should simply pop the view controller, your 'Save' IBAction should do the same after it has updated the task

Your Detail View should follow the 'updateViews' pattern for updating the view elements with the details of a model object. 

1. Add an `updateViews()` function
2. Implement the function to update all view elements that reflect details about the model object (in this case, the name text field, the due date text field, and the notes text view) and also have it check to see if the view has been loaded.
    * note: Dates require some extra work when we try to set them to labels. We'll implement an extension on `Date` using DateFormatter to get a prettier label in the next step.
3. Call `updateViews()` in your `viewDidLoad()`


### Date Formatting

Dates are a notoriously difficult programming problem. Date creation, formatting, and math are all challenging for beginner programmers. This section will walk you through creating helper functions, setting dates, and using a date picker in place of a keyboard to set a date label.

Because `Date`s do not print in a user readable format, Apple includes the `DateFormatter` class to convert dates into strings and strings back into dates. We will add an extension to `Date` and make a reusable `stringValue()` function that returns a formatted string.

You could place this extension code directly into the view controller that will display the view, but creating an extension in a separate file allows you to reuse the code throughout the application and reuse the file in other projects you work on in the future.

1. Add a new `DateHelpers.swift` file and define an extension on `Date`
2. Create a `stringValue() -> String` function that instantiates a `DateFormatter`, sets the dateStyle, and returns a string from the date.

```
func stringValue() -> String {
    let formatter = DateFormatter()
    formatter.dateStyle = .medium
    
    return formatter.stringFromDate(self)
}
```

3. Go back to your `updateViews()` function and use `task.due.stringValue()` to set the text for the due label (you may have to cast `task.due` to `Date` first)


### Capture the Due Date

UIDatePicker is used to capture date and time information from a user. By setting a UIDatePicker to the inputView of a UITextField, a UIDatePicker will appear in place of the traditional keyboard. You can use a target action, delegate, or IBAction to capture the date that the user selects and set that to a variable.

1. Add a UIDatePicker object as a supplementary view to the detail scene
    * note: Drag a UIDatePicker object to the outline area of the Storyboard and Interface Builder will drop it directly beneath the First Responder object
2. Set the UIDatePicker to Date mode
3. Create an IBOutlet named `dueDatePicker` from the UIDatePicker supplementary view to the class file
4. In `viewDidLoad()`, set the date picker as the `taskDueTextField`s input view
    * hint: `taskDueTextField.inputView = dueDatePicker`
5. Create an IBAction from the UIDatePicker supplementary view to the class file named `datePickerValueChanged`
    * note: Choose UIDatePicker as the sender type so that you do not need to cast the object to get the date off of it
6. Implement the action to store the updated date value to `dueDateValue` and to set the `taskDueTextField.text` to the string value from the date picker's date

Dismissing the keyboard can be done in many ways. When using a custom keyboard you have two common options: add a toolbar with a 'Done' button that resigns the first responder as the field's input accessory, or add a `UITapGestureRecognizer` that does the same. We'll do the latter.

1. Add a `UITapGestureRecognizer` object to the table view on the Task Detail Scene (just drag it out the same way you did with the `UIDatePicker`)
2. Create an IBAction from the `UITapGestureRecognizer` named `userTappedView` that resigns the first responder on all text fields or text views


### Segue

Recall that you created two segues from the List View to the Detail View. The segue from the plus button will tell the `TaskDetailTableViewController` that it should create a new task. The segue from a selected cell will tell the `TaskDetailTableViewController` that it should display a previously created task and save any changes made to it.

1. If you haven't already, give the segue from a table view cell to the detail view an identifier.
2. Add a `prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?)` function to the `TaskListTableViewController` if it's not there already
3. Implement the `prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?)` function. Be sure to check the `identifier` of the `segue`, get the `destination` of the `segue`, then get the index path for the selected row and use that index path to pass the selected task to the `task` property on the `TaskDetailTableViewController`
    * note: You will also want to pass the `due` property from your selected task to the `dueDateValue` property in your `TaskDetailTableViewController`
4. Go to the `TaskDetailTableViewController` class and update your `task` property to a computed property that uses a `didSet` property observer to call `updateViews()` every time `task` gets set. Thus, when you pass the `task` from your `prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?)` function to the `task` computed property it will update the views to reflect the properties of the selected task.


### Custom Table View Cell

Build a custom table view cell to display tasks. The cell should display the task name and have a button that acts as a checkmark to display and toggle the completion status of the task.

It is best practice to make table view cells reusable between apps. As a result, you will build a `ButtonTableViewCell` rather than a `TaskTableViewCell` that can be reused any time you want a cell with a button. You will add an extension to the `ButtonTableViewCell` for updating the view with a Task.

1. Add a new `ButtonTableViewCell.swift` as a subclass of UITableViewCell
2. Assign the new class to the prototype cell on the Task List Scene in `Main.storyboard`
3. Design the prototype cell with a label on the left and a square button on the right margin
    * note: If you are using a stack view, constrain the aspect ratio of the button to 1:1 to force the button into a square that gives the remainder of the space to the label
    * note: Use the image edge inset to shrink the image to not fill the entire height of the content view, you can adjust the image edge insets in the Size Inspector of the UIButton
4. Remove text from the button, but add a image of an empty checkbox
    * note: Use the 'complete' and 'incomplete' image assets included in the project folder
5. Create an IBOutlet for the label named `primaryLabel`
6. Create an IBOutlet for the button named `completeButton`
7. Create an IBAction for the button named `buttonTapped` which you will implement using a custom protocol in the next step

Implement the 'update(with:)' pattern in and extension on the `ButtonTableViewCell` class.

1. Add an `updateButton(_ isComplete: Bool)` function that updates the button's image to the desired image based on the `isComplete` Bool
2. Add an extension to `ButtonTableViewCell` at the bottom of the class file
3. Add a function `update(withTask task: Task)` that updates the label to the name of the task and calls the `updateButton(_ isComplete: Bool)` function to update the image
4. Update the `tableView(_:cellForRowAt:)` table view data source function in your `TaskListTableViewController` class to call `update(withTask task: Task)` instead of setting the text label directly (you will have to cast your `cell` to be a `ButtonTableViewCell`)


### Custom Protocol

Write a protocol for the `ButtonTableViewCell` to delegate handling a button tap to the `TaskListTableViewController`, adopt the protocol, and use the delegate method to mark the task as complete and reload the cell.

1. Add a protocol named `ButtonTableViewCellDelegate` to the bottom of the class file
2. Define a required `buttonCellButtonTapped(_ sender: ButtonTableViewCell)` function
3. Add an optional delegate property on the `ButtonTableViewCell`
    * note: `var delegate: ButtonTableViewCellDelegate?`
4. Update the `buttonTapped` IBAction to check if a delegate is assigned, and if so, call the delegate protocol function
5. Adopt the protocol in the `TaskListTableViewController` class
6. Implement the `buttonCellButtonTapped` delegate function to capture the Task as a property, toggle `task.isComplete`, and reload the tapped row. Don't forget to set your delegate in your `tableView(_:cellForRowAt:)` function!
    * note: You will need to create a function in `TaskController` called `toggleIsCompleteFor(task: Task)` that toggles the `isComplete` Bool on the Task object passed into the function, this is how you will toggle the `task.isComplete` in your delegate function

At this point you should be able to run your project and toggle tasks for the mock tasks you created.


### Persistence With Core Data

Implement your function signatures in `TaskController` to be able to persist to Core Data. Begin by importing `CoreData`.

1. Your `saveToPersistentStore()` function should call the `save()` function on the `NSManagedObjectContext` you set up in the `CoreDataStack`.
    * note: The `save()` function on an `NSManagedObjectContext` instance is a 'throwing function' so be sure to account for if it throws an error.
2. Your `fetchTasks -> [Task]` function needs to initialize a `NSFetchRequest` and then use that fetch request to fetch `Task` objects from the managed object context.
    * note: There is a `fetch(_:)` function on instances of `NSManagedObjectContext` that returns the an array of objects that meet the criteria specified by the request. Thus, you can return the result of that function in your `fetchTasks()` function. `fetch(_:)` is also a throwing function so be sure to account for an error.
    * note: To initialize a `NSFetchRequest` use the following syntax: `let request: NSFetchRequest<Task> = Task.fetchRequest()`
    * note: You can also delete your mock tasks that you created earlier at this point
3. Your `add(taskWithName name: String, notes: String?, due: Date?)` function should initialize a task object, save the managed object context using `saveToPersistentStore()`, and then fetch tasks from the managed object context and assign the returned tasks to your controller's `tasks` array.
    * note: Initializing a subclass of `NSManagedObject` like `Task` automatically puts it into the Core Data managed object context so you don't need to initialize a `Task` and put it anywhere.
4. Your `update(task: Task, name: String, notes: String?, due: Date?)` function needs to set the `name`, `notes`, and `due` property on the passed in `task` to be equal to the new `name`, `notes`, and `due` values passed into the function parameters. Then your function needs to call `saveToPersistentStore()` and set the `tasks` array to the return result of `fetchTasks()`.
5. Your `remove(task: Task)` function should delete the task from the managed object context, save the managed object context, and then fetch tasks from the managed object context and assign the returned tasks to your `tasks` array.
    * note: You can get the managed object context from the task you passed into your function since every managed object exists in a managed object context.
6. Also be sure to update your `toggleIsCompleteFor(task: Task)` function to `saveToPersistentStore()`.

Your app should now be able to create, update, and remove tasks. It should also persist to Core Data. Test the app and be sure to check if persistence is working. Check for and fix any bugs you might find.


### Black Diamonds

* Add support for projects (task parent object), or tags (task child object) to categorize your tasks
* Create a Unit test that verifies project or tag functionality by converting an instance to and from Data
* Add support for due date notifications scheduled to fire when the task is due
* Create a Unit test that verifies notification scheduling
* Add a segmented control as the title view that toggles whether the table view should display complete or incomplete tasks
* Add support for entering 'Editing' mode on a table view and add a cell that allows you to [insert](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TableView_iPhone/ManageInsertDeleteRow/ManageInsertDeleteRow.html) new tasks
* Add automatic resizing to the table view cell with the Notes text view
* Update the settings for the checkbox images to [inherit the tint color](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19829356/color-tint-uibutton-image) of the button
* Add 'incompleteTasks' and 'completedTasks' arrays and use an NSFetchRequest with an NSPredicate to return the correct results
* Implement a Fetched Results Controller for the Table View DataSource


## Part Two - NSFetchedResultsController

### Prepare Project to use NSFetchedResultsController

An NSFetchedResultsController has properties that allow you to access fetched objects, thereby replacing the `tasks` array that is currently on the TaskController. It also takes the place of the `fetchTasks()` function. Consequently, you will delete those items from the TaskController and remove the TaskListTableViewController entirely and start from scratch.

1. Delete your `tasks` array.
2. Delete your `fetchTasks()` function and all references to it.
3. Delete your entire file `TaskListsTableViewController.swift`.
    * note: When prompted and asked whether to remove reference or move to trash, choose move to trash.


### Add an NSFetchedResultsController to TaskController

NSFetchedResultsController is an API that allows you to easily sync a table view with information stored in Core Data. In order to use it, you must initialize it with an NSFetchRequest, a managed object context, the name of the variable you want your sections divided by, and an optional cache name. In our case, we do not need a cache, so we will leave it as nil.

1. Add a constant to your `TaskController` called `fetchedResultsController` that is of type `NSFetchedResultsController<Task>`. 
2. You should get a compiler error saying you need to initialize this property. In your initializer, create a fetch request similar to the one you had before, but with a sort descriptor for `isComplete` and a sort descriptor for `due`, in that order. This ensures that the tasks will be sorted by whether or not they are complete first and then by their due date.
3. Initialize your fetchedResultsController using your fetch request, `CoreDataStack.context`, and the key by which you want to divide sections (we want a section for incomplete tasks and a section for complete tasks).


### Perform Fetch Using NSFetchedResultsController

An NSFetchedResultsController will keep you updated of any changes to the data in your Core Data model once a fetch has been performed, but you still must perform the initial fetch.

1. Inside your initializer, after having initialized your fetchedResultsController, you will need to call `performFetch()` on it.
    * note: You will need to use the do, try, catch syntax since `performFetch()` is a throwing function. The catch should print out an error if there is one.


### Basic Task List View

Rebuild a view that lists all tasks. You will use a UITableViewController and implement the UITableViewDataSource functions. Apple's documentation for an NSFetchedResultsController describes exactly how to implement the UITableViewDataSource functions. There are examples in Swift beneath each Objective C example. However, note that the style differs slightly from the style you have been taught here at DevMountain. You should do your best to keep your code style consistent to what we have been learning the last weeks (i.e. safely unwrapping optionals, etc.). You can find the example needed in the section titled "Integrating the Fetched Results Controller with the Table View Data Source" in the [Core Data Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/ConceptualCoreDataStacknsfetchedresultscontroller.html).

You will want this view to reload the table view each time it appears in order to display newly created tasks.

1. Implement the `numberOfSections(in:)` function. Remember to use documentation for help on this.
2. Implement the `numberOfRows(inSection:)` function.
3. Implement the `cellForRow(at indexPath: IndexPath)` function by dequeuing your cell and casting it as your custom cell, getting the right task object, calling your custom cell's `update(withTask:)` function, and setting the cell's delegate. Don't forget to adopt and conform to the `ButtonTableViewDelegate` protocol. We will implement the delegate method later. 
4. Implement the `tableView(_:titleForHeaderInSection:)` function to return the proper section title. There is no example of this in the Core Data Programming Guide. However, each object in the array of `NSFetchedResultsSectionInfo` objects that you get from the Fetched Results Controller contains a name property that is a string representing the index of the section. You can convert this to an `Int` and use it to determine whether your header should say "Incomplete" or "Complete". Use the `sections` property on your `fetchedResultsController` to get your array of `NSFetchedResultsSectionInfo` objects.
4. Implement your `prepare(for segue: NSStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?)` function to pass the selected task and the selected task's `due` value to the next screen if a cell was tapped.


### List View Editing

Add swipe-to-delete support for deleting tasks from the List View and implement the `ButtonTableViewCellDelegate` function.

1. Go to your UITableViewDataSource `tableView(_:commit:forRowAt:)` function to enable swipe to delete functionality. When committing the editing style, delete the model object from the controller, but do not delete the cell from the table view. We will implement an `NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate` method to do this once the object is deleted.
    * note: Use `TaskController.shared.fetchedResultsController.object(at: indexPath)` to get the correct `Task` object to delete.
2. Go to your `ButtonTableViewCellDelegate` function and call `TaskController.shared.toggleIsCompleteFor(task: task)` to toggle the `isComplete` property on the passed in `Task` object.
    * note: Again, use `TaskController.shared.fetchedResultsController.object(at: indexPath)` to get the correct `Task` object. You'll also have to use `sender` to get the correct index path.


### Using the NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate

Use `NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate` functions to be notified of and respond to changes in the underlying Core Data information. The Core Data Programming Guide has examples of this as well in the section "Communication Data Changes to the Table View".

1. Import `CoreData` into the TaskListTableViewController and then adopt the `NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate` protocol in the class signature.
2. In `viewDidLoad()` set `self` as the delegate for the `fetchedResultsController` on the `TaskController`.
3. Look up `NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate` in documentation. There are four functions that are called when the controller's fetch results have changed that will update the table view to correctly display the right data. You will need to implement all of them, so write the function signatures for all of them.
4. The delegate function `controllerWillChangeContent(_:)` will be called before any change occurs and the delegate function `controllerDidChangeContent(_:)` will be called after changes occur. Sometimes there will be multiple changes that need to occur to a table view, some of which need to happen simultaneous to other changes. For this to work, the table view needs to know to execute all changes at the same time. This is done by calling `tableView.beginUpdates()` and then after all of the changes have been made, calling `tableView.endUpdates()`. You should begin updates in the function that will be called before changes happen and you should end updates in the function that will be called after those changes happen.  
5. The delegate method `controller(_ controller: NSFetchedResultsController<NSFetchRequestResult>, didChange anObject: Any, at indexPath: IndexPath?, for type: NSFetchedResultsChangeType, newIndexPath: IndexPath?)` tells you what type of change has happened, whether an object was added, deleted, moved, or updated. To be safe, we should check for the type of change and respond accordingly. This is a great situation to use a switch statement. Go ahead and switch on `type` with the four different cases: `.delete`, `.insert`, `.move`, and `.update`. 
6. For the `.delete` case, you simply need use the line of code you included in your `tableView(_:commit:forRowAt:)` function before you deleted the `TaskListTableViewController.swift` file: `tableView.deleteRows(at: [indexPath], with: .fade)`. This is because when you delete an object, this delegate function will be called and you want the table view to reflect the changes made in your fetch results.
    * note: Be sure to safely unwrap `indexPath`
7. For the `.insert` case, you can use a similar line of code to insert a row at a given indexPath: `tableView.insertRows(at: [newIndexPath], with: .automatic)`.
8. Using the two table view functions used in the previous two steps, attempt to fill out the `.move` case.
9. Search documentation to find a table view function that you can use to reload a row at a given index path in order to implement the `.update` case.
10. The delegate method `controller(_ controller: NSFetchedResultsController<NSFetchRequestResult>, didChange sectionInfo: NSFetchedResultsSectionInfo, atSectionIndex sectionIndex: Int, for type: NSFetchedResultsChangeType)` will be called if a section needs to be added or deleted. Again, the `type` variable passed into the function will tell you if a section needs to be added or deleted. Use documentation and the Core Data Programming Guide to implement this function.

The app is now finished. Run it, check for bugs, and fix any that you find.
